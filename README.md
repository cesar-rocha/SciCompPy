### Code of conduct

We value the participation of everyone and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the workshop. The same standards of behaviour are expected on our interactions online.

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in this student organized event is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout event.

We want to promote a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

* Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

* All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event.

* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.

* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. People violating these rules may be asked to leave the event or be excluded from the online venue at the sole discretion of the organizers, without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.

This code of conduct is adapted from [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/).
