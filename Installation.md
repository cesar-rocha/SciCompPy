# Installation of scientific python environment

## Anaconda
Install [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) with python 3.5.
This is a free scientific python platform available for Linux, OSX and Windows.
We call it scientific python because anaconda ships with the main packages (
libraries and ``toolboxes'' if you will) used in science.
