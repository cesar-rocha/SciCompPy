# Installation of scientific python environment

## Anaconda
Install [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) with python 3.5.
This is a free scientific python platform available for Linux, OSX and Windows.
We call it scientific python because anaconda ships with the main packages (
libraries and "toolboxes" if you will) used in science such as numpy, scipy,
and matplotlib.

## Why Python 3?
Most of scientific packages support python3. If you are a python newbie,
you should start using python3. PSF will drop support to python2 by 2020
and Jupyter Project next version (6.0) will no longer support python2.

If you never heard of differences between python2 and python3, you do not
need to worry. For us, the changes are minimum.

If you currently use python2, consider migrating to python3. I encourage you
to check out this [webpage](http://python-3-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that some friends have put together to help scientists
migrate from 2 to 3.
